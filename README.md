# Racso qtile config

This configurations is the result of many years of configuring and testing different alternatives. I have been working with many wm (qtile, awesome, bspwm ... etc) and alternative bars like (eww) to force my self to learn new things and experiment with all but finally, i get what i think is my best setup

it is extensible in any way that you can imagine. With a simple coding language like python and custom menu implementations with eww.
